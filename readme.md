## Youtube Player Change To Embed
### Youtube Anti Adblock Bypasser

This script removes the youtube error and adds an Embed video on top, which works perfectly like the original. If you want to help improve it, feel free.

Youtube Error Example:
![ad blockers violate youtube's terms of service](/screenshots/yt-error-message.png)

Some videos may not work, as the creator can remove the "embed" option from the video, but it will be rare to find one that does this.

For some reason not yet known, if you don't click on the video and try to use the shortcut F for full screen, it will make the video reload.
To avoid this, right click on the full screen button, or click on the video once and then press F.

This script will do nothing if an adblock is not active
